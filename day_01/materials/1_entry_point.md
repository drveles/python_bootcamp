# Program entry point, program structure

"Program entry point" refers to the place where program execution begins. 
In most cases, the entry point is an executable script containing the code that will be executed when the program is run. Such a script usually contains a function named `main()`, and this function is considered the entry point.

An example of a simple Python script:

```python
def main():
    print("Hello, world!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this example, the `main()` function represents the basic logic of the program. 
The condition if `if __name__ == "__main__":` is then used, to check if the script is executed directly (rather than imported as a module in another program).
If the script is executed directly, the `main()` function is called . This structure allows you to easily use code from other programs by importing it as a module, while avoiding executing the underlying logic if the script is used as a module.

Python program structure can also include variable declarations, function definitions, conditional statements  (`if`, `else`, `elif`), loops (`for`, `while`), and other elements, depending on the complexity of the program. For example, the structure of a program might look like this:

```python
# Импорт модулей
# Module import
from module2 import function2

# Variable definition
variable1 = 42
variable2 = "Example"


# Function definition
def my_function():
    print("This is my finction")


# Basic logic of the program
if variable1 > 0:
    my_function()
else:
    print("Variable less than or equal to zero")

# Calling functions from other modules
module1.function1()
function2()
```

The general idea is to organize the code so that it is readable, easily maintainable, and can be used effectively both in the script itself and in other programs via import as a module.
