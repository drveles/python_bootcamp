# Memory management, garbage collector

Python automatically manages memory and provides a high-level interface for working with objects, without requiring the programmer to explicitly manage memory as some other programming languages do.

**Garbage collector** is a is a mechanism that automatically frees memory occupied by objects that are no longer used in the program. The garbage collector analyzes objects that are no longer referenced and frees the memory they occupied. This helps avoid memory leaks and ensures efficient resource utilization.

In Python, there is a garbage collector called a "reference counter". It tracks the number of references to each object. When the number of references to an object becomes zero, the garbage collector automatically frees the memory occupied by that object.

However, Python also offers other garbage collection mechanisms such as mark and sweep and generational mechanism. These mechanisms are much more complex, but they allow for more efficient memory management, which can sometimes be useful.
